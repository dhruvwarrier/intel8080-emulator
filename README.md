# intel8080-emulator

An emulator for the Intel 8080 microprocessor, written in C89/ANSI C. 
Supports asynchronous interrupts and emulates part of the CP/M 2.2 BIOS for 8080 binaries that target it.

I've tried my best to make this as portable and accurate as possible! I'd appreciate any feedback towards this goal.

### Portability:
- Written in C89/ANSI C, taking advantage of C99 features if available.
- Tested with gcc 6.3.0 -std=c89 and WebAssembly/emcc on Debian 9, and with MSVC on Windows 8.
- Attempt made to support async interrupts on as many environments as possible **(see i8080_predef.h and i8080_sync.c)**. This is untested, but should work on Windows versions >= XP, POSIX environments >= 199506, and GNUC compilers >= version 4.7.0.
### Accuracy:
- Passes test roms TST8080.COM and CPUTEST.COM from Microcosm Associates (Kelly Smith test) and Supersoft Associates 1980-1981.
- More tests to be added!
### libi8080emu, libi8080
This project consists of two libraries: libi8080emu, and libi8080emu/libi8080. 
- libi8080 is the core emulation library and can be used standalone to emulate an i8080.
- libi8080emu wraps around libi8080 to provide debugging functionality and CP/M 2.2 BIOS emulation.

### Command line tool:
Frontend to libi8080emu, to run tests or other ROMs from the command line.
```
i8080-emu, an emulator for the INTEL 8080 microprocessor with some CP/M 2.2 BIOS support.
Supports async interrupts, CPM 2.2 BDOS ops 2 and 9, and a simple command processor at CP/M WBOOT.

Usage: i8080-emu [options]
Options:
   -h   --help                  Print this help message.
   -e   --env ENV               Set the environment. "default" or "cpm".
   -f   --file FILE             Execute the file as i8080 binary.
   --run-all-tests              Run all the test files under tests/.
```
